 - change the buffer size for shuffling dataset to a bigger value
    - done (buffer size was set to 100,000)
 - fix the bug of dev_accuracy
    - done
 - fix the bug in BLEU evaluation
    - done
 - test Graph.finalize()
    - done
 - find and try a way of evaluating on dev dataset without feedable initializer
 - try sp32000
    - done
 - added global step variable
 
 - When doing evaluation, reference should be the text at the phase right before final tokenization
    ex. if the preprocessing is 'moses tokenization' -> Trucaser -> 'sentencepiece tokenization' reference texts should be the one after Trucasing.
